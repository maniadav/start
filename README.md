# START Project

The START project aims to develop a mobile, modular, open-source platform for early detection of autism risk by non-specialist health workers in low-resource settings.

## Field Study Results

Results from the field study in India using the app are available:

- [Autism Risk Detection in Low-Resource Settings](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613231182801)
- [Individual Component Results 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265587)
- [Individual Component Results 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04064)

The code for the START app is available for free on GitHub: [START Repository](https://github.com/Manishyadav514/START).

## Project Overview

The initial phase of the project was supported by the [Medical Research Council UK](http://www.mrc.ac.uk) Global Challenge Research Fund and focused on India. The START platform uses a combination of parent reports and direct child assessments to detect autism risk in children aged 2-5 years. The tablet-based assessment includes several small tests, questionnaires, and observations, briefly described [here](/overview).

## Integration with STREAM

START is now part of the [STREAM platform](https://research.reading.ac.uk/stream), which assesses different domains of neurodevelopment in children between the ages of 0 and 6 years in India and Malawi.

# START App Data Format

The data collected for the each task includes 3 attempts per assessment. Each assessment has a unique `assestment_id`, and a maximum of three attempts (`noOfAttempt` â‰¤ 3) is allowed. Each generated csv file contains the data of all three attempts depending on how many attempta has been made. The structure of the data is as follows:

## Notes

- Each attempt has its corresponding `timeLimit`, which by default is 3 min.
- Users can attempt the task a maximum of three times, and data is recorded separately for each attempt but stored in a single `csv` file.
- `attempt<attempt_number>_touchX` and other similar fields use `<attempt_number>` to represent attempt 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- Assessment specific metrics will only be available in their respective assessment type.

## Common Data Metrics

These fields are shared across all tasks:

# Deployment
## Deployment on gh-pages

1. Assets will be fetched from URLs related to your GitHub account. Update the base URL in your config constant accordingly, for example:
   ```ts
   export const BASE_URL = "/start";
   ```
2. Set the `isGithub` flag to `true` in your `next.config.mjs` file.
3. Update asset paths in `public/manifest.json` to use the correct base path (e.g., `/<your_github_repo>/icons/icon-192.png`).
4. Ensure all static assets and routes reference the correct base path for GitHub Pages deployment.
5. Deploy your app to GitHub Pages as usual.
