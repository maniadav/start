# START App Data Format

The data collected for the each task includes 3 attempts per assessment. Each assessment has a unique `assessment_id`, and a maximum of three attempts (`noOfAttempt` â‰¤ 3) is allowed. Each generated csv file contains the data of all three attempts depending on how many attempta has been made. The structure of the data is as follows:

## Notes

- Each attempt has its corresponding `timeLimit`, which by default is 3 min.
- Users can attempt the task a maximum of three times, and data is recorded separately for each attempt but stored in a single `csv` file.
- `attempt<attempt_number>_touchX` and other similar fields use `<attempt_number>` to represent attempt 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- Assessment specific metrics will only be available in their respective assessment type.

## Common Data Metrics

These fields are shared across all tasks:
